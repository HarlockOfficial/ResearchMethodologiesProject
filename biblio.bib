Complex input output mappings are dealt in deep learning, which is developed based on machine learning approach. Due to its efficiency and similarity to the working of the human brain, deep neural networks are a preferred method of processing and analysing medical data. In addition to diagnosis, deep learning is used to study the progression of disease, develop a personalised treatment plan and for overall patient management. This chapter discusses the architecture and working of deep neural networks and focus on its application in the detection and treatment of various diseases like cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.",

abstract="While designing medical diagnosis software, disease prediction is said to be one of the captious tasks. The techniques of machine learning have been successfully employed in assorted applications including medical diagnosis. By developing classifier system, machine learning algorithm may immensely help to solve the health-related issues which can assist the physicians to predict and diagnose diseases at an early stage. We can ameliorate the speed, performance, reliability, and accuracy of diagnosing on the current system for a specific disease by using the machine learning classification algorithms. This paper mainly targets the review of diabetes disease detection using the techniques of machine learning. Further, PIMA Indian Diabetic dataset is employed in machine learning techniques like artificial neural networks, decision tree, random forest, na{\"i}ve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and logistic regression and discussed the results with their pros and cons.",

abstract = {Diabetes is a metabolic disorder comprising of high glucose level in blood over a prolonged period in the body as it is not capable of using it properly. The severe complications associated with diabetes include diabetic ketoacidosis, nonketotic hypersmolar coma, cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic renal failure, retinal damage and foot ulcers. There is a huge increase in the number of patients with diabetes globally and it is considered a major health problem worldwide. Early diagnosis of diabetes is helpful for treatment and reduces the chance of severe complications associated with it. Machine learning algorithms (such as ANN, SVM, Naive Bayes, PLS-DA and deep learning) and data mining techniques are used for detecting interesting patterns for diagnosing and treatment of disease. Current computational methods for diabetes diagnosis have some limitations and are not tested on different datasets or peoples from different countries which limits the practical use of prediction methods. This paper is an effort to summarize the majority of the literature concerned with machine learning and data mining techniques applied for the prediction of diabetes and associated challenges. This report would be helpful for better prediction of disease and improve in understanding the pattern of diabetes. Consequently, the report would be helpful for treatment and reduce risk of other complications of diabetes.}

abstract = {Disease prediction is a well-known classification problem in medical applications. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) provide a powerful tool for analyzing the patientsâ€™ features relative to each other. This can be achieved by modeling the problem as a graph node classification task, where each node is a patient. Due to the nature of such medical datasets, class imbalance is a prevalent issue in the field of disease prediction, where the distribution of classes is skewed. When the class imbalance is present in the data, the existing graph-based classifiers tend to be biased towards the major class(es) and neglect the samples in the minor class(es). On the other hand, the correct diagnosis of the rare positive cases (true-positives) among all the patients is vital in a healthcare system. In conventional methods, such imbalance is tackled by assigning appropriate weights to classes in the loss function which is still dependent on the relative values of weights, sensitive to outliers, and in some cases biased towards the minor class(es). In this paper, we propose a Re-weighted Adversarial Graph Convolutional Network (RA-GCN) to prevent the graph-based classifier from emphasizing the samples of any particular class. This is accomplished by associating a graph-based neural network to each class, which is responsible for weighting the class samples and changing the importance of each sample for the classifier. Therefore, the classifier adjusts itself and determines the boundary between classes with more attention to the important samples. The parameters of the classifier and weighting networks are trained by an adversarial approach. We show experiments on synthetic and three publicly available medical datasets. Our results demonstrate the superiority of RA-GCN compared to recent methods in identifying the patientâ€™s status on all three datasets. The detailed analysis of our method is provided as quantitative and qualitative experiments on synthetic datasets.}
